To force scripts to run in Bash rather than current shell use:
#!/bin/bash

C:
	gcc -o output_filename filename.c (Compile_)
	./files/filename (Run)

Java:
	javac ./files/filename.java (Compile)
	java -cp "./files/" filename (Run)

Bash:
	./files/filename.sh (Run)
	Used chmod to set privileges for scripts to make them executable.

Previous experience in Java made it easier to write than Bash, but Bash scripts were much simpler than Java programs to complete the two tasks.
Java's complex handling of input and output make file manipulation quite involved, whereas Bash is designed for use in an OS.
Basic Google/StackOverflow searches resolved any issues with not knowing the correct command/how to use it.
Overall Bash was much easier and simpler.

Java offers much more functionality and allows much more complex programs, but for small tasks like these Bash is a lot easier. 
As with previous courses, Google, StackOverflow and the Java documentation were invaluable.
